1. Markup
   Write a program that asks the user to enter an item’s wholesale cost and its markup
   percentage.It should then display the item’s retail price.For example :
   • If an item’s wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 100 %, then the
     item’s retail price is 10.00.
   • If an item’s wholesale cost is 5.00 and its markup percentage is 50%, then the item’s
     retail price is 7.50.
The program should have a function named calculateRetail that receives the
wholesale cost and the markup percentage as arguments and returns the retail price
of the item.
Input Validation: Do not accept negative values for either the wholesale cost of the
item or the markup percentage.
    

    float wholeSale, markUp;
    cout << "Wholesale cost: ";
    while (cin >> wholeSale && wholeSale < 0)
        cout << "No negative value. Re-enter";
    cout << "Mark up cost: ";
    while (cin >> markUp && markUp < 0)
        cout << "No negative value. Re-enter";

    cout << setprecision(2) << fixed << showpoint;
    cout << "The retail price is: $" << wholeSale + calculateRetail(wholeSale, markUp);
   

  
2. Rectangle Area—Complete the Program
If you have downloaded this book’s source code from the companion Web site, you
will find a partially written program named AreaRectangle.cpp in the Chapter 06
folder. (The companion Web site is at www.pearsonhighered.com / gaddis .) Your job is
to complete the program. When it is complete, the program will ask the user to enter
the width and length of a rectangle and then display the rectangle’s area.The program
calls the following functions, which have not been written :
• getLength – This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s length and
then return that value as a double .
• getWidth – This function should ask the user to enter the rectangle’s width and then
return that value as a double .
• getArea – This function should accept the rectangle’s length and width as arguments
and return the rectangle’s area.The area is calculated by multiplying the
length by the width.
• displayData – This function should accept the rectangle’s length, width, and area
as arguments and display them in an appropriate message on the screen.   
    

    double length = getLength();
    double width = getWidth();
    double area = getArea(length, width);

    displayData(length, width, area);

 
3. Winning Division
Write a program that determines which of a company’s four divisions(Northeast,
Southeast, Northwest, and Southwest) had the greatest sales for a quarter.It should
include the following two functions, which are called by main .
• double getSales() is passed the name of a division.It asks the user for a division’s
quarterly sales figure, validates the input, then returns it.It should be called once for
each division.
• void findHighest() is passed the four sales totals.It determines which is the largest
and prints the name of the high grossing division, along with its sales figure.
Input Validation : Do not accept dollar amounts less than $0.00.
    
    double sales1, sales2, sales3, sales4;
  
    cout << "Northeast Division\n";
    sales1 = getSales();
    cout << "Southeast Division\n";
    sales2 = getSales();
    cout << "Northwest Division\n";
    sales3 = getSales();
    cout << "Southwest Division\n";
    sales4 = getSales();

    findHighest(sales1, sales2, sales3, sales4);
    

4. Safest Driving Area
Write a program that determines which of five geographic regions within a major city
(north, south, east, west, and central) had the fewest reported automobile accidents last
year.It should have the following two functions, which are called by main .
• int getNumAccidents() is passed the name of a region.It asks the user for the
number of automobile accidents reported in that region during the last year, validates
the input, then returns it.It should be called once for each city region.
• void findLowest() is passed the five accident totals.It determines which is the
smallest and prints the name of the region, along with its accident figure.
Input Validation : Do not accept an accident number that is less than 0.


    string region[5] = { "north", "south", "east", "west", "central" };
    int act[5];

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << "------" << region[i] << "------";
        act[i] = getNumAccident();
    }

    findLowest(act[0], act[1], act[2], act[3], act[4], region);
 
5. Falling Distance
When an object is falling because of gravity, the following formula can be used to
determine the distance the object falls in a specific time period :
d = 1/2(gt^2)
The variables in the formula are as follows : d is the distance in meters, g is 9.8, and t
is the amount of time, in seconds, that the object has been falling.
Write a function named fallingDistance that accepts an object’s falling time(in
seconds) as an argument.The function should return the distance, in meters, that the
object has fallen during that time interval. Write a program that demonstrates the
function by calling it in a loop that passes the values 1 through 10 as arguments and
displays the return value.
 


    for (int i = 1; i <= 10; i++)
    {
        if (i == 1)
        {
            cout << i << " second : " << fallingDistance(i) << " meters.\n";
        }
        else {
            cout << i << " seconds : " << fallingDistance(i) << " meters\n";
        }
    }
   
6. Kinetic Energy
In physics, an object that is in motion is said to have kinetic energy.The following
formula can be used to determine a moving object’s kinetic energy :
KE = 1/2(mv^2)
The variables in the formula are as follows : KE is the kinetic energy, m is the object’s
mass in kilograms, and v is the object’s velocity, in meters per second.
Write a function named kineticEnergy that accepts an object’s mass(in kilograms)
and velocity(in meters per second) as arguments.The function should return the
amount of kinetic energy that the object has.Demonstrate the function by calling it in
a program that asks the user to enter values for mass and velocity.


    double mass, velocity;

    cout << "Enter the mass (kg): ";
    cin >> mass;
    cout << "Enter the velocity (m/s): ";
    cin >> velocity;

    cout << "The kinetic energy is: " << kineticEnery(mass, velocity) << " joules.\n";

7. Celsius Temperature Table
The formula for converting a temperature from Fahrenheit to Celsius in
C = 5/9(F-32)
where F is the Fahrenheit temperature and C is the Celsius temperature. Write a function
named celsius that accepts a Fahrenheit temperature as an argument.The function
should return the temperature, converted to Celsius.Demonstrate the function by
calling it in a loop that displays a table of the Fahrenheit temperatures 0 through 20
and their Celsius equivalents.

    double faren, cel;

    cout << "Enter the Farenheit degree and we will convert it into Celsius\n";
    cin >> faren;

    cel = Celsius(faren);

    cout << faren << "F\370 = " << cel << "C\370";
  
8. Coin Toss
Write a function named coinToss that simulates the tossing of a coin.When you call
the function, it should generate a random number in the range of 1 through 2. If the
random number is 1, the function should display “heads.” If the random number is 2,
the function should display “tails.” Demonstrate the function in a program that asks
the user how many times the coin should be tossed and then simulates the tossing of
the coin that number of times.
   
    coinToss(5);

9. Present Value
    Suppose you want to deposit a certain amount of money into a savings account and
    then leave it alone to draw interest for the next 10 years.At the end of 10 years you
    would like to have $10,000 in the account. How much do you need to deposit today to make 
    that happen? You can use the following formula, which is known as the present
    value formula, to find out :
        P = F /(1+r)^n
    The terms in the formula are as follows :
    • P is the present value, or the amount that you need to deposit today.
    • F is the future value that you want in the account. (In this case, F is $10,000.)
    • r is the annual interest rate .
    • n is the number of years that you plan to let the money sit in the account.
    Write a program that has a function named presentValue that performs this calculation.
    The function should accept the future value, annual interest rate, and number of
    years as arguments.It should return the present value, which is the amount that you
    need to deposit today. Demonstrate the function in a program that lets the user experiment
    with different values for the formula’s terms.
    

        float presentVal, futureVal, annualRate, numYears;
        cout << "Expected future value amount\n";
        cin >> futureVal;

        cout << "Annual interest rate\n";
        cin >> annualRate;

        cout << "Number of years\n";
        cin >> numYears;

        presentVal = presentValue(futureVal, annualRate, numYears);
        cout << "In order to get $" << futureVal << " you must put $" << presentVal << " in bank now.\n";

10. Future Value
    Suppose you have a certain amount of money in a savings account that earns compound
    monthly interest, and you want to calculate the amount that you will have after a specific
    number of months.The formula, which is known as the future value formula, is:
    F = P x (1+i)^t
    The terms in the formula are as follows :
    • F is the future value of the account after the specified time period.
    • P is the present value of the account.
    • i is the monthly interest rate .
    • t is the number of months .
    Write a program that prompts the user to enter the account’s present value, monthly
    interest rate, and the number of months that the money will be left in the account.The
    program should pass these values to a function named futureValue that returns the
    future value of the account, after the specified number of months.The program should
    display the account’s future value.

          float accValue, monthlyRate; int numMonth;
          cout << "Enter current account value: $";
          cin >> accValue;

          cout << "Montly interest rate: ";
          cin >> monthlyRate;

          cout << "Number of months money will be left in: ";
          cin >> numMonth;

          futureValue(accValue, monthlyRate, numMonth);

11. Lowest Score Drop
Write a program that calculates the average of a group of test scores, where the lowest
score in the group is dropped.It should use the following functions :
• void getScore() should ask the user for a test score, store it in a reference parameter
variable, and validate it.This function should be called by main once for each
of the five scores to be entered.
• void calcAverage() should calculate and display the average of the four highest
scores.This function should be called just once by main and should be passed the
five scores.
• int findLowest() should find and return the lowest of the five scores passed to it.
It should be called by calcAverage, which uses the function to determine which of
the five scores to drop.
Input Validation : Do not accept test scores lower than 0 or higher than 100.


          const int numTest = 5;
          float score1, score2, score3, score4, score5;

          getScore(score1);
          getScore(score2);
          getScore(score3);
          getScore(score4);
          getScore(score5);

          calcAverage(score1, score2, score3, score4, score5);

12. Star Search
A particular talent competition has five judges, each of whom awards a score between
0 and 10 to each performer.Fractional scores, such as 8.3, are allowed.A performer’s
final score is determined by dropping the highestand lowest score received, then averaging
the three remaining scores.Write a program that uses this method to calculate a
contestant’s score.It should include the following functions :
• void getJudgeData() should ask the user for a judge’s score, store it in a reference
parameter variable, and validate it.This function should be called by main once for
each of the five judges.
• void calcScore() should calculateand display the average of the three scores that
remain after dropping the highestand lowest scores the performer received.This
function should be called just once by mainand should be passed the five scores.
The last two functions, described below, should be called by calcScore, which uses
the returned information to determine which of the scores to drop.
• int findLowest() should findand return the lowest of the five scores passed to it.
• int findHighest() should find and return the highest of the five scores passed to it.
Input Validation : Do not accept judge scores lower than 0 or higher than 10.

    float score1, score2, score3, score4, score5;
    getJudgeScore(score1);
    getJudgeScore(score2);
    getJudgeScore(score3);
    getJudgeScore(score4); 
    getJudgeScore(score5);
    calScore(score1, score2, score3, score4, score5);
    
13. Days Out
Write a program that calculates the average number of days a company’s employees
are absent. The program should have the following functions:
• A function called by main that asks the user for the number of employees in
the company. This value should be returned as an int . (The function accepts no
arguments.)
• A function called by main that accepts one argument: the number of employees in
the company. The function should ask the user to enter the number of days each
employee missed during the past year. The total of these days should be returned as
an int .
• A function called by main that takes two arguments: the number of employees in
the company and the total number of days absent for all employees during the year.
The function should return, as a double , the average number of days absent. (This
function does not perform screen output and does not ask the user for input.)
Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of employees. Do
not accept a negative number for the days any employee missed.
