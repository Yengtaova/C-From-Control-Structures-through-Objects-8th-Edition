 /*5. Average of Values
      To get the average of a series of values, you add the values up and then divide the sum
      by the number of values.Write a program that stores the following values in five different

    Suppose an employee gets paid every two weeks and earns $2,200 each pay period.

        the variable with 26.
        annualPay This variable will hold the employee�s total annual pay, which will
        be calculated.
    The program should calculate the employee�s total annual pay by multiplying the
    employee�s pay amount by the number of pay periods in a year and store the result in
    the annualPay variable.Display the total annual pay on the screen.
