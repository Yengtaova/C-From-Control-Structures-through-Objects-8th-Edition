1. Sum of Numbers
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should use
a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example,
if the user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, … 50.
Input Validation: Do not accept a negative starting number.

    int input, sum = 0;
    cout << "Please enter a number and we will do a sum up from 1 to your enter number: ";
    cin >> input;

    while (input <= 0) {
        cout << "No negative value or zero. Enter again.";
        cin >> input;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= input; i++)
        sum += i;

    cout << "The sum from 1 to " << input << " is " << sum;
    
2. Characters for the ASCII Codes
Write a program that uses a loop to display the characters for the ASCII codes 0
through 127. Display 16 characters on each line.

   for (int i = 0, y = 0; i <= 127; i++, y++)
    {
        if (y == 17)
            cout << "\n";
        cout << char(i) << " ";
    }

3. Ocean Levels
Assuming the ocean’s level is currently rising at about 1.5 millimeters per year, write
a program that displays a table showing the number of millimeters that the ocean will
have risen each year for the next 25 years.

    const float RISING_LEVEL = 1.5; //millimeter per year
    float seaLevel = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (++i <= 25) {
        seaLevel += RISING_LEVEL;
        cout << i << " year: " << seaLevel << " millimeters.\n";
    }

4. Calories Burned
Running on a particular treadmill you burn 3.6 calories per minute. Write a program that
uses a loop to display the number of calories burned after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes.

    const float CAL_PER_MINUTE = 3.6;
    float calBurn;

    for (int i = 5; i <= 30; i += 5)
    {
        calBurn = i * CAL_PER_MINUTE;
        cout << i << " minutes: " << calBurn << " cal.\n";
    }

5. Membership Fees Increase
A country club, which currently charges $2,500 per year for membership, has
announced it will increase its membership fee by 4% each year for the next six years.
Write a program that uses a loop to display the projected rates for the next six years.

    const int CHARGE_PER_YEAR = 2500;
    float membershipIncrease = 0.04;
    float accumulate = CHARGE_PER_YEAR;
    float increase;

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        increase = accumulate * membershipIncrease;
        accumulate += increase;
        cout << i + 1 << " year: $" << accumulate << endl;
    }
