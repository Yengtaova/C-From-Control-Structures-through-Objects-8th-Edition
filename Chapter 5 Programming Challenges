1. Sum of Numbers
Write a program that asks the user for a positive integer value. The program should use
a loop to get the sum of all the integers from 1 up to the number entered. For example,
if the user enters 50, the loop will find the sum of 1, 2, 3, 4, … 50.
Input Validation: Do not accept a negative starting number.

    int input, sum = 0;
    cout << "Please enter a number and we will do a sum up from 1 to your enter number: ";
    cin >> input;

    while (input <= 0) {
        cout << "No negative value or zero. Enter again.";
        cin >> input;
    }

    for (int i = 1; i <= input; i++)
        sum += i;

    cout << "The sum from 1 to " << input << " is " << sum;
    
2. Characters for the ASCII Codes
Write a program that uses a loop to display the characters for the ASCII codes 0
through 127. Display 16 characters on each line.

   for (int i = 0, y = 0; i <= 127; i++, y++)
    {
        if (y == 17)
            cout << "\n";
        cout << char(i) << " ";
    }

3. Ocean Levels
Assuming the ocean’s level is currently rising at about 1.5 millimeters per year, write
a program that displays a table showing the number of millimeters that the ocean will
have risen each year for the next 25 years.

    const float RISING_LEVEL = 1.5; //millimeter per year
    float seaLevel = 0;
    int i = 0;
    while (++i <= 25) {
        seaLevel += RISING_LEVEL;
        cout << i << " year: " << seaLevel << " millimeters.\n";
    }

4. Calories Burned
Running on a particular treadmill you burn 3.6 calories per minute. Write a program that
uses a loop to display the number of calories burned after 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes.

    const float CAL_PER_MINUTE = 3.6;
    float calBurn;

    for (int i = 5; i <= 30; i += 5)
    {
        calBurn = i * CAL_PER_MINUTE;
        cout << i << " minutes: " << calBurn << " cal.\n";
    }

5. Membership Fees Increase
A country club, which currently charges $2,500 per year for membership, has
announced it will increase its membership fee by 4% each year for the next six years.
Write a program that uses a loop to display the projected rates for the next six years.

    const int CHARGE_PER_YEAR = 2500;
    float membershipIncrease = 0.04;
    float accumulate = CHARGE_PER_YEAR;
    float increase;

    for (int i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        increase = accumulate * membershipIncrease;
        accumulate += increase;
        cout << i + 1 << " year: $" << accumulate << endl;
    }

6. Distance Traveled
The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:
distance = speed * time
For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is
120 miles.
Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how
many hours it has traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the distance the
vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the output:

What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40
How many hours has it traveled? 3
Hour Distance Traveled
--------------------------------
1           40
2           80
3          120

Input Validation: Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any
value less than 1 for time traveled.


7. Pennies for Pay
Write a program that calculates how much a person would earn over a period of time
if his or her salary is one penny the first day and two pennies the second day, and continues
to double each day. The program should ask the user for the number of days.
Display a table showing how much the salary was for each day, and then show the
total pay at the end of the period. The output should be displayed in a dollar amount,
not the number of pennies.

Input Validation: Do not accept a number less than 1 for the number of days worked.
