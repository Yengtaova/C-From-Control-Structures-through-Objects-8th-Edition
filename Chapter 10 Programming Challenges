1. String Length
Write a function that returns an integer and accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument.
The function should count the number of characters in the string and return that
number. Demonstrate the function in a simple program that asks the user to input a
string, passes it to the function, and then displays the function’s return value.

2. Backward String
Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and displays its
contents backward. For instance, if the string argument is “ Gravity ” the function
should display “ ytivarG ”. Demonstrate the function in a program that asks the user
to input a string and then passes it to the function.

3. Word Counter
Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and returns the
number of words contained in the string. For instance, if the string argument is “Four
score and seven years ago” the function should return the number 6. Demonstrate the
function in a program that asks the user to input a string and then passes it to the function.
The number of words in the string should be displayed on the screen. Optional
Exercise: Write an overloaded version of this function that accepts a string class object
as its argument.

4. Average Number of Letters
Modify the program you wrote for Problem 3 (Word Counter), so it also displays the
average number of letters in each word.

5. Sentence Capitalizer
Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and capitalizes
the first character of each sentence in the string. For instance, if the string argument
is “ hello. my name is Joe. what is your name? ” the function should manipulate
the string so it contains “ Hello. My name is Joe. What is your name? ”
