int main()
{
1. String Length
Write a function that returns an integer and accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument.
The function should count the number of characters in the string and return that
number. Demonstrate the function in a simple program that asks the user to input a
string, passes it to the function, and then displays the function’s return value.

    const int SIZE = 50;
    char input[SIZE];

    cout << "Enter the string\n";
    cin.getline(input, SIZE);

    int length = strLength(input);

    cout << "There are " << length << " characters in your string input.\n";

2. Backward String
Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and displays its
contents backward. For instance, if the string argument is “ Gravity ” the function
should display “ ytivarG ”. Demonstrate the function in a program that asks the user
to input a string and then passes it to the function.

    const int SIZE = 50;
    char input[SIZE];

    cout << "Enter your string and we will reverse it.\n";
    cin.getline(input, SIZE);

    reverse(input);


3. Word Counter
Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and returns the
number of words contained in the string. For instance, if the string argument is “Four
score and seven years ago” the function should return the number 6. Demonstrate the
function in a program that asks the user to input a string and then passes it to the function.
The number of words in the string should be displayed on the screen. Optional
Exercise: Write an overloaded version of this function that accepts a string class object
as its argument.

    const int SIZE = 80;
    char input[SIZE];

    cout << "Enter your string and we will count the number of the word.\n";
    cin.getline(input, SIZE);

    int num = wordCount(input);

    cout << "There are " << num << " words in your string.\n";
   
    //string version
    string input2 = "Hello nice to meet you";
    int num2 = wordCount(input2);

    cout << "\nThere are " << num2 << " words in your string.\n";

4. Average Number of Letters
Modify the program you wrote for Problem 3 (Word Counter), so it also displays the
average number of letters in each word.

    const int SIZE = 80;
    char input[SIZE];

    cout << "Enter your string and we will count the number of the word.\n";
    cin.getline(input, SIZE);

    double aveLetter = averageLetter(input);

    cout << "The average number of letters in each word is " << aveLetter << endl;

5. Sentence Capitalizer
Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as an argument and capitalizes
the first character of each sentence in the string. For instance, if the string argument
is “ hello. my name is Joe. what is your name? ” the function should manipulate
the string so it contains “ Hello. My name is Joe. What is your name? ”
Demonstrate the function in a program that asks the user to input a string and then
passes it to the function. The modified string should be displayed on the screen.
Optional Exercise: Write an overloaded version of this function that accepts a string
class object as its argument.

    const int SIZE = 80;
    char input[SIZE];

    cout << "Enter the string\n";
    cin.getline(input, SIZE);

    capitalize(input);

6. Vowels and Consonants
Write a function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as its argument. The function
should count the number of vowels appearing in the string and return that number.
Write another function that accepts a pointer to a C-string as its argument. This function
should count the number of consonants appearing in the string and return that
number.
Demonstrate these two functions in a program that performs the following steps:
1. The user is asked to enter a string.
2. The program displays the following menu:
A) Count the number of vowels in the string
B) Count the number of consonants in the string
C) Count both the vowels and consonants in the string
D) Enter another string
E) Exit the program
3. The program performs the operation selected by the user and repeats until the user
selects E to exit the program.

    const int SIZE = 80;
    char word[SIZE];
    char input;

    cout << "Please enter the string\n";
    cin.getline(word, SIZE);

    do {
       
        menu();
        cin >> input;

        while (toupper(input) != 'A' && toupper(input) != 'B' && toupper(input) != 'C' && toupper(input) != 'D' && toupper(input) != 'E')
        {
            cout << "Invalid input. Enter again: ";
            cin >> input;
        }


        switch (input)
        {
        case 'a':
        case 'A':
            vowelsFind(word);
            break;
        case 'b':
        case 'B':
            consFind(word);
            break;
        case 'c':
        case 'C':
            vowelsFind(word);
            consFind(word);
            break;
        case 'd':
        case 'D':
            cin.ignore();
            cout << "Enter new string: ";
            cin.getline(word, SIZE);
            break;
        }
    } while (toupper(input) != 'E');

7. Name Arranger
Write a program that asks for the user’s first, middle, and last names. The names
should be stored in three different character arrays. The program should then store,
in a fourth array, the name arranged in the following manner: the last name followed
by a comma and a space, followed by the first name and a space, followed by the
middle name. For example, if the user entered “ Carol Lynn Smith ”, it should store
“ Smith, Carol Lynn ” in the fourth array. Display the contents of the fourth array
on the screen.

    const int SIZE= 15,
              SIZE2= 30;
    
    char first[SIZE];
    char middle[SIZE];
    char last[SIZE];
    char fullName[SIZE2];
    
    cout << "Enter your first name: ";
    cin.getline(first,SIZE);
    
    cout << "Middle name: ";
    cin.getline(middle, SIZE);
    
    cout << "Last name: ";
    cin.getline(last, SIZE);
    
    //add fullname with last name and comma and space
    int maxChars = sizeof(fullName) - (strlen(fullName)+1);
    
    strncat(fullName, last, maxChars);
    strncat(fullName, ", ", maxChars);
    strncat(fullName, first, maxChars);
    strncat(fullName, ", ", maxChars);
    strncat(fullName, middle, maxChars);
    
    cout << "\n" <<fullName << endl;

8. Sum of Digits in a String
Write a program that asks the user to enter a series of single digit numbers with nothing
separating them. Read the input as a C-string or a string object. The program should
display the sum of all the single-digit numbers in the string. For example, if the user
enters 2514, the program should display 12, which is the sum of 2, 5, 1, and 4. The
program should also display the highest and lowest digits in the string.

    const int SIZE = 10;
    char number[SIZE];
    
    cout << "Please enter the your desire number (no more than 10 digit): ";
    cin.getline(number, SIZE);
    
    int total =0;
    int index = 0;
    int high = number[index] - '0';
    int low = number[index] - '0';
    
    while(number[index] != '\0'){
        total += (number[index] - '0');  //since the char value is not an actual integer.                                //We will need to substract 0 out of it. If we use                              //string, we will use atoi()
        if(number[index] - '0' > high)
            high = number[index]- '0';
        if(number[index] - '0' < low)
            low = number[index] - '0';
        index++;
    }
    
    cout << "The sum of your number is " << total << endl;
    cout << "The highest digit number is " <<  high << endl;
    cout << "The lowest digit number is " << low << endl;

9. Most Frequent Character
Write a function that accepts either a pointer to a C-string, or a string object, as its
argument. The function should return the character that appears most frequently in the
string. Demonstrate the function in a complete program.

10. replaceSubstring Function
Write a function named replaceSubstring . The function should accept three C-string
or string object arguments. Let’s call them string1 , string2 , and string3 . It
should search string1 for all occurrences of string2 . When it finds an occurrence of
string2 , it should replace it with string3 . For example, suppose the three arguments
have the following values:
string1 : “the dog jumped over the fence”
string2 : “the”
string3 : “that”
With these three arguments, the function would return a string object with the value
“that dog jumped over that fence.” Demonstrate the function in a complete program.

11. Case Manipulator
Write a program with three functions: upper , lower , and reverse . The upper function
should accept a pointer to a C-string as an argument. It should step through each character
in the string, converting it to uppercase. The lower function, too, should accept a
pointer to a C-string as an argument. It should step through each character in the string,
converting it to lowercase. Like upper and lower , reverse should also accept a pointer
to a string. As it steps through the string, it should test each character to determine
whether it is upper- or lowercase. If a character is uppercase, it should be converted to
lowercase. Likewise, if a character is lowercase, it should be converted to uppercase.
Test the functions by asking for a string in function main , then passing it to them in
the following order: reverse , lower , and upper

12. Password Verifier
Imagine you are developing a software package that requires users to enter their own
passwords. Your software requires that users’ passwords meet the following criteria:
• The password should be at least six characters long.
• The password should contain at least one uppercase and at least one lowercase letter.
• The password should have at least one digit.
Write a program that asks for a password and then verifies that it meets the stated
criteria. If it doesn’t, the program should display a message telling the user why.

13. Date Printer
Write a program that reads a string from the user containing a date in the form mm/dd/yyyy.
It should print the date in the form March 12, 2014.

14. Word Separator
Write a program that accepts as input a sentence in which all of the words are run
together, but the first character of each word is uppercase. Convert the sentence to a
string in which the words are separated by spaces and only the first word starts with
an uppercase letter. For example the string “StopAndSmellTheRoses.” would be converted
to “Stop and smell the roses.”

15. Character Analysis
If you have downloaded this book’s source code from the companion Web site, you
will find a file named text.txt in the Chapter 10 folder. (The companion Web site is
at www.pearsonhighered.com/gaddis .) Write a program that reads the file’s contents
and determines the following:
• The number of uppercase letters in the file
• The number of lowercase letters in the file
• The number of digits in the file
